The purpose of this repository is to provide a public and open-source list of rss sources that can be used by the [*Unconditional.*]("https://unconditional.day") project. 
# How to add a new source
The list is stored in the source.json file. The file contains a list of objects. Each object represents a source. The object has the following structure:
```json
{
    "name": "The name of the source",
    "url": "The url of the rss feed",
}
```
To add a new source is very simple:
1. Fork the repository
2. Add the new source to the source.json file following the structure above
3. Make a pull request
4. Wait for the pull request to be accepted and merged
